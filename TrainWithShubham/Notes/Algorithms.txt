Algorithms

Searching
Linear Search
list_of_envs = ["dev","stg","prd"]
Value to search = "stg"

Step 1 = Start
Step 2 = Define the list of envs and the key to search
Step 3 = Use for loop to iterate through each element in the list
Step 4 = Use if condition to compare each element in list with key
Step 5 = if comparison is True = Element Found
         else Element not found
Step 6 = Stop

Time Complexity
for loop --> n times; O(n)
if condition --> 1 time; O(1)



Sorting
Bubble Sort

Step1 = Start
Step2 = Use a for loop to iterate over all elements of the list using variable i
Step3 = Use a second nested for loop to compare element i with all other elements in the list using variable j
Step4 = If the element at position i is less than element at position j, then swap the elements using a temporary variable
    4a) Place the value of the element at position i in the temp variable
	4b)	Replace the value of element at position j with the value of element at position i
	4c)	Finally use the value in the temp variable to replace the value of the element at position j
Step5 = Repeat this process for each of the remaining elements in the list to get the sorted list
Step6 = Stop

Nested for loops
for(n)
	for(n)
TC: O(n^2) and not O(2*n)



Input a list of Numbers from user i.e take integer inputs and append to list.
Find the smallest and Second Smallest Numbers from that list

Step1 = Start
Step2 = Create an empty list using [] brackets or using list() function
Step3 = Take user input for range ie. total number of elements to be added to the list. Cast the input from string to integer
Step4 = Use a for loop to iterate over the range to enter individual elements in the list. Cast each input from string to integer
Step5 = Use a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list
Step6 = Use another for loop to compare each element with every other element in the list
Step7 = If the element at position i is less than element at position j, then swap the elements using a temporary variable
    7a) Place the value of the element at position i in the temp variable
	7b)	Replace the value of element at position j with the value of element at position i
	7c)	Finally use the value in the temp variable to replace the value of the element at position j
Step8 = Repeat this process for each of the remaining elements in the list to get the sorted list
Step9 = Print the first element of the list to get smallest number
Step10= Print the second element of the list to get second smallest number
Step11 = Stop
