### Compiler vs Interpreter
- Python is a top down interpreter. It starts looking for statements from the top of the code and moves down<br />
- For eg. when if else loop is execute, python interpreter will first check the if statement and any statement within the if loop<br />
- Then it will check the else statement after checking all the statements in the if loop<br />

### Python uses both compiler and interpreter combined
- A compiler will compile the whole piece of code and look for errors within the code.<br />
- If there are any syntax related errors or other errors, the code will not be executed. The execution will throw an error<br />
- Instead we have to first fix the errors to make it execution ready<br />
- Once the errors in the code are fixed, then interpreter will be able to interpret the inputs one by one<br />
- For eg.) in a code where 2 numbers to need to be taken as input and the operator will be third input<br />
  python interpreter will be able to interpret all the 3 inputs one by one<br />
- Then it will be able to interpret the output based on the operator<br />
- And finally it print the output of the operator based on the operator<br />

### Importing a library
- When deciding to import a library, go to [pypi.org](pypi.org). This is the python project index<br />
- This is the place where python libraries are present and uploaded by developers<br />
- So lets say if you dont know how docker works, go to [pypi.org](pypi.org) and search for docker<br />
- Then use the docker pacakge which has good documentation and explains commands very well<br />
