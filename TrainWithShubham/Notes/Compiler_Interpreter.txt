Compiler vs Interpreter
- Python is a top down interpreter. It starts looking for statements from the top of the code and moves down
- for eg. when it needs to execute if else loop, python interpreter will first check the 


Python uses both compiler and interpreter combined
- A compiler will compile the whole piece of code and look for errors within the code.
- If there are any syntax related errors or other errors, the code will not be executed. The execution will throw an error
- Instead we have to first fix the errors to make it execution ready
- Once the errors in the code are fixed, then interpreter will be able to interpret the inputs one by one
- for eg.0 in a code where 2 numbers to need to be taken as input and the operator will be third input
  python interpreter will be able to interpret all the 3 inputs one by one
- Then it will be able to interpret the output based on the operator
- And finally it print the output of the operator based on the operator


Importing a library
- When deciding to import a library, go to pypi.org. This is the python project index
- This is the place where python libraries are present and uploaded by developers
- So lets say if you dont know how docker works, go to pypi.org and search for docker
- Then use the docker pacakge which has good documentation and explains commands very well
